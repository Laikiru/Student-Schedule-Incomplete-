README:
INCOMPLETED Student Schedule
Twas a project for BeachHacks 2021, but in the end Java was used for the program. Still serves as a sort of basis for the code and whatnot.

Objective:
- Help better time management with a schedule creator.
- Input time and task a student would want to do for the day.
- Output it in a schedule/list.
- Ability to add multiple parts to the list, delete from the list, see the schedule, or exit the program.
